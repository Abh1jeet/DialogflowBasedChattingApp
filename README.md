## what is webhook

Webhooks are "user-defined HTTP callbacks" They are usually triggered by some event ,,,,
When that event occurs, the source site makes an HTTP request to the URL configured for the webhook

### (query) user -> dialogflow -> webhook
### (output)user <- dialoglow  <- webhook

So basically user asks a query and using geocity our program extracts name of country from that sentence
That country is passed to webhook which fetches name of capital of that country 
Then webhook gives response to dialogflow which shows output to user
